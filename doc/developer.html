    <h2>Assumptions of the results.</h2>
    When you call a certain entity you get always the simple properties of the entity you asked for (in a EntityAsSubject), plus a summary of the container and list of entities (EntityAsListitem) it belongs to.
    When you call a list of entities (filtered or not) you will receive a list of summarizes (EntityAsListitem) of the entities in the list.
    When you call an endpoint to edit or add an object and it succeed, you receive in the body the object which you editted or created. This means you can get attributes which are always empty after creating, because that is in reality too.
