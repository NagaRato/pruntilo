# pruntilo
*REST-API to administrate all your borrow stuff.*

## Status of development
This version of pruntilo is a prototype. Concrete does it means this version does not fit for entreprise purposes, only for demonstrations to see what such system can do for you.

## Summary
The concept is simple, pruntilo contains a list with stuff (elements you borrow) and members (people you do allow to borrow your stuff).
In between are loanings, they contain an ID, the date a member took stuff (took), and the date on which you agreed he will bring the stuff back (brought).

## For developers of other systems and dedicated frontends
If you want to connect your system or own frontend and you want to know which endpoint are available, what they require and what you can expect in which situations, you can read [the api specifications](developer.html).

## For systems admins and private machine unsers
If you want to show/see pruntilo can do for you or your organisation, please install the following things to let this work:
- Java 8
- Angular
- node.js
- node package manager
